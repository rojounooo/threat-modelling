# Hypothetical To-Do List Web App – Threat Modeling

## Overview
This repository contains a **hypothetical threat model** for a simple to-do list web application.  
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to analyze a web service for security threats, design mitigations, and document system architecture.  

> **Note:** This project is purely hypothetical. No runnable application or backend exists.

## Key Features of the Service
- User registration and login with session tokens
- Create, update, and delete personal notes
- Backend database for storing user credentials and notes
- Web frontend interacting with API via HTTPS

## Security Highlights
- Strong password hashing and salting
- Rate limiting and optional CAPTCHA for login
- Protection against SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF
- Centralized logging for auditing user actions
- Enforced HTTPS and secure cookie flags

## How to Use This Repo
- Read `docs/threat_model.md` to understand threat identification and risk assessment
- Consult `docs/architecture.md` for a visual/system decomposition
- Review `docs/security.md` for mitigation strategies and security policies
- Use this as a reference or teaching example for threat modelling and secure design

## Disclaimer
This repository is a **conceptual demonstration** and is not intended for production use.  
No live application or backend is included; all scenarios are hypothetical.
